    <h1>Graphical Password Authentication</h1>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>
      Background: Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly
      any website. But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on
      numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project
      illustrating graphical password strategy. This will allow the user to set
      passwords in the form of graphical presentation in a certain pattern and
      later use that pattern to login o the system. Summary: Remembering
      numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a
      user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical
      password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user
      has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their
      password. Objective: : In this method, the user is required to select some
      images (letâ€™s say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example
      dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and
      so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been
      shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which
      was used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence
      while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication
      is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks
      could breach it. We need techniques that can be easily implemented and
      provide better results to this process. ```

    <h1>Objective</h1>

    <p>
      <code>
        To create password authentication system but instead of typing the
        password, the user needs to select a sequence of randomly placed images
        in correct order which was set by the user earlier
      </code>
    </p>

    <h1>WorkFlow</h1>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand authentication systems and protocols</li>
        <li>Understanding CAPTCHA verification works</li>
        <li>
          Mixing 1 and 2 may work as authentication instead of human
          verification.
        </li>
      </ol>
