<h1>Network Traffic Analyzer</h1>

<p><code>
Background: Also called “Packet Sniffing”, network traffic analysis and monitoring is a process used to keep an eye on all incoming and outgoing traffic, network activity, and availability. It is used to detect anomalies, identifying operational issues, comparing real-time networks with historical data to identify potential threats and issues. For a project, you can analyze the data packets that are sent across the network. After analyzing these packets you can work on a report to give your insights, and if required, countermeasures if there is an anomaly.

<h1>Objective:</h1>

<p><code>
 We need a software in which using your networking skills you can find out such anomalies in the network also as an extension, you could also devise software that could identify if there is a traffic analyzer in the network by an external agent."

<h1>Keypoints</h1>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
<li>A software to identify the threats or vulnerabilities on th Network</li>
<li>Find a countermeasures for the identified threat</li>
<li>Also find if any traffic analyser present in the network</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h1>workflow</h1>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
<li>Create command-line tool to inspect the packets and genrating the report</li>
<li>Send random <strong>ICMP</strong> packets to all device in the network and analyse the respondend packets and report the unreachable packets and devices</li>

<h1>Graphical Password Authentication</h1>

<p><code>
Background:
 Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly any website. But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project illustrating graphical password strategy. This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to login o the system. Summary: Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password. Objective: : In this method, the user is required to select some images (let’s say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it. We need techniques that can be easily implemented and provide better results to this process.

<h1>Objective</h1>

<p><code>
To create password authentication system but instead of typing the password, the user needs to select a sequence of randomly placed images in correct order which was set by the user earlier
