    <h1> Hologram Speech Synthesis </h1>

    <p>
      <code>
 	
"Background: There are many events in the past where we don't find audio visual recordings in the archives.
 Many notable personalities from India have delivered iconic speeches in the past which are not recorded. 
 These famous speeches by notable individuals will be synthesized from the transcript available.
  Their speeches will be presented through a three-dimensional hologram to provide people with a realistic experience. 
  Summary: To develop a speech synthesis algorithm to bring historic speeches delivered by legendary personalities in the past back to life.
