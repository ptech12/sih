    <h1>Network Traffic Analyzer</h1>

    <p>
      <code>
        Background: Also called “Packet Sniffing”, network traffic analysis and
        monitoring is a process used to keep an eye on all incoming and outgoing
        traffic, network activity, and availability. It is used to detect
        anomalies, identifying operational issues, comparing real-time networks
        with historical data to identify potential threats and issues. For a
        project, you can analyze the data packets that are sent across the
        network. After analyzing these packets you can work on a report to give
        your insights, and if required, countermeasures if there is an anomaly.

    <h1>Objective:</h1>

    <p>
      <code>
        We need a software in which using your networking skills you can find
        out such anomalies in the network also as an extension, you could also
        devise software that could identify if there is a traffic analyzer in
        the network by an external agent."

    <h1>Keypoints</h1>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A software to identify the threats or vulnerabilities on th Network
        </li>
        <li>Find a countermeasures for the identified threat</li>
        <li>Also find if any traffic analyser present in the network</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <h1>workflow</h1>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create command-line tool to inspect the packets and genrating the
          report
        </li>
        <li>
          Send random <strong>ICMP</strong> packets to all device in the network
          and analyse the respondend packets and report the unreachable packets
          and devices
        </li>
      </ol>
